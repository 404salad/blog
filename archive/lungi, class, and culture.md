hostel guy denied me wearing lungi INSIDE the hostel
asked me where im from  said its not allowed said its a night dress
(he called it a dhoti)

some security head outside also said the same
this guy asked me if i was a faculty 

workers outside wear lungi and they are allowed to,  

it wouldnt be classist if it was consistent but the rules arent consistent

possible title -> poor mans clothes
