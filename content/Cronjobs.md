> running stuff in the background at a specified time is awesome

I forget to backup my files and so i use cron to do it for me.  
Here is a basic rundown- 
- crontab is the tab of all cronjobs
- run `crontab -e` it will ask for setup, use your favorite editor

```
export EDITOR=nvim
```
now run `crontab -e` again and you should be able to access the file
```
# Add this line to your crontab file to run the backup every day at 2 AM
0 2 * * * rsync -ah --info=progress2 /path/to/source /path/to/destination
```
those asterics are wildcards! It means run it everytime  
use this command format examples for cronjobs
